# photos-sync
synchronizes converted and raw photos folders.

You may have folder with raw photos, and script will create equal folder structure with photos converted for fast view (.jpg of screen size).
Once built, folder structures are tracked and synchronized.
i.e. raw is updated -> view file regenerated.

view file is moved -> raw file is moved.
view file is deleted -> raw file is deleted.
(the same for other side).
